. Why Should You Use DDPI? DDPI makes frequent trading of shares a hassle-free process. You should definitely consider using DDPI because it allows Angel One to perform the following functions on your behalf â€“ Transferring shares from your demat account to the exchange upon their sale. Pledging/re-pledging of securities in favour of a Trading Member (TM) or Clearing Member (CM) for meeting margin requirements. Transferring mutual fund units from your demat account upon their sale. Transferring your shares in open offers ( ie. buybacks/delisting/acquisitions) on the stock exchange. Therefore, the entire process of selling and pledging becomes much smoother across asset classes
