Topic: bank account

. I have made a BTST (Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow) trade. When can I place a funds payout request? In BTST transactions, withdrawal requests can be placed on T+1 day (The next working day) after the selling transaction is executed. I have 2 bank accounts. I want to receive funds from my secondary bank account. What should I do? While withdrawing, Angel One gives you the option to select a bank account in which you want to receive the funds. The amount will get credited to the bank account you have chosen. I have placed multiple withdrawal requests. Why was only one request processed at a time? If you place multiple withdrawal requests with different bank accounts within the payout cycle, the system will process only one bankâ€™s withdrawal request at a time
