Name Mismatch Issue This means that there is currently an issue of mismatch between the name provided in the application data and the name given in the submitted documents. 5.

    "content": ". Why Should You Use DDPI? DDPI makes frequent trading of shares a hassle-free process. You should definitely consider using DDPI because it allows Angel One to perform the following functions on your behalf – Transferring shares from your demat account to the exchange upon their sale. Pledging/re-pledging of securities in favour of a Trading Member (TM) or Clearing Member (CM) for meeting margin requirements. Transferring mutual fund units from your demat account upon their sale. Transferring your shares in open offers ( ie. buybacks/delisting/acquisitions) on the stock exchange. Therefore, the entire process of selling and pledging becomes much smoother across asset classes",

Unsettled balance – If a user earns a profit today and tries to withdraw the amount today itself, even though the amount from all the transactions has not been settled yet, then this amount is counted as unsettled balance.

I have received money through a sell transaction but my withdrawable balance still shows zero money. Why is this so? It takes time for the transaction to be settled. Therefore, until the settlement of the money involved in the sell transaction has happened, the withdrawable balance will not change.

Therefore, when the withdrawal happens, only ₹800 will be withdrawn. The remaining ₹200 withdrawal will be executed once the account again has ₹200 or more. Other reasons for partial withdrawals Partial withdrawals can also occur because of any of the following reasons: Margin requirements Initiated new trade Accrual charges For example: Assume you have Rs. 1000 as a withdrawable balance at the beginning of the day i.e. 9:00 am.

After placing the request, you entered into an intraday trade and suffered a loss of Rs. 100 (including Brokerage, Taxes, and other statutory charges), leaving your clear ledger balance to be Rs. 900. Hence, when your withdrawal request is processed, you will receive Rs. 900 in your account and not Rs. 1000. In this case, the loss of Rs. 100 due to the intraday transaction modified the amount you received. Similarly, if there is any change in the margin requirements or any accrual charges that need payment, you will receive only a partial amount. Why is my withdrawable balance zero or not matching my trading account balance? It may happen because you have unsettled balances in your account",

You can withdraw these on Wednesday.

Unsettled balance – If a user earns a profit today and tries to withdraw the amount today itself, even though the amount from all the transactions has not been settled yet, then this amount is counted as unsettled balance.

I have received money through a sell transaction but my withdrawable balance still shows zero money. Why is this so? It takes time for the transaction to be settled. Therefore, until the settlement of the money involved in the sell transaction has happened, the withdrawable balance will not change.

Therefore, when the withdrawal happens, only ₹800 will be withdrawn. The remaining ₹200 withdrawal will be executed once the account again has ₹200 or more. Other reasons for partial withdrawals Partial withdrawals can also occur because of any of the following reasons: Margin requirements Initiated new trade Accrual charges For example: Assume you have Rs. 1000 as a withdrawable balance at the beginning of the day i.e. 9:00 am. And you have placed a funds payout request of Rs. 1000",

    "content": ". 9:00 am. And you have placed a funds payout request of Rs. 1000. After placing the request, you entered into an intraday trade and suffered a loss of Rs. 100 (including Brokerage, Taxes, and other statutory charges), leaving your clear ledger balance to be Rs. 900. Hence, when your withdrawal request is processed, you will receive Rs. 900 in your account and not Rs. 1000. In this case, the loss of Rs. 100 due to the intraday transaction modified the amount you received. Similarly, if there is any change in the margin requirements or any accrual charges that need payment, you will receive only a partial amount. Why is my withdrawable balance zero or not matching my trading account balance? It may happen because you have unsettled balances in your account",

You can withdraw these on Wednesday. So on Monday and Tuesday, you will see withdrawable balance as zero and unsettled balance as ₹1000. • Funds received from exiting F&O position can be withdrawn on the next working day • For example, suppose you have a ₹1000 F&O sell transaction on Monday.

Other reasons for partial withdrawals Partial withdrawals can also occur because of any of the following reasons: For example: Assume you have Rs. 1000 as a withdrawable balance at the beginning of the day i.e. 9:00 am.

Hence, when your withdrawal request is processed, you will receive Rs. 900 in your account and not Rs. 1000. In this case, the loss of Rs. 100 due to the intraday transaction modified the amount you received. Similarly, if there is any change in the margin requirements or any accrual charges that need payment, you will receive only a partial amount. It may happen because you have unsettled balances in your account. This can happen because of the following reasons: Funds added cannot be withdrawn on the same day itself.
