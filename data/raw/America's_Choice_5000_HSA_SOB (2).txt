Important Questions  Answers  Why This Matters:  
What is the overall 
deductible ? $5,000/individual or $ 10,000/family   Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible  amount before this 
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must 
meet their own individual deductible  until the total amount of deductible  expenses paid by all 
family members meets the overall family deductible . 
Are there services 
covered before you meet 
your deductible ? Yes. Preventive care services are 
covered before you meet your 
deductible . This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible  amount.  
But a copayment  or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan  covers certain preventive 
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible . See a list of covered 
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive- care-benefits/ . 
Are there other  
deductibles  for specific 
services?  No.   You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for 
other costs for services this plan covers.  
What is the out -of-p ocket 
limit for this plan ? $6,550/individual or $ 13,100/family  The out-of-pocket limit  is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have 
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out -of-pocket limits  until the 
overall family out -of-pocket limit  has been met.  
What is not included in  
the out-of-pocket limit ? Premiums , balanced -billing  
charges, and health care this plan 
doesn’t cover . Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out -of-p ocket limit.  
Will you pay less if you 
use a network provider ? No network restrictions.     
Do you need a referral  to 
see a specialist ? No.  You don’t need a referral to see 
a specialist.  You can see the specialist  you choose without permission from this plan.
